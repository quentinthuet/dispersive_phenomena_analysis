Duo work (Paul Brunet - Quentin Thuet)

The goal of this project is to model the dispersion of a product in a moving river.

Most of the files are draft files, only Projet_Brunet_Thuet.py and Concentration_Modia.py provide interesting plots.

THE PROJECT
The width of the river is constant, as well of its speed.
We have to deal with diffusive and advective flows.
After some approximations, we implemented the Crank Nicholson method.
